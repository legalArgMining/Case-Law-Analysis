ORDER

I.A. No. 401 and 403 of 2016

1. These applications have been filed by South Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Corporation seeking permission for registration of diesel vehicles used for collection and transportation of garbage on diesel based HCV and MCV vehicles. Mr. Mehta, learned Counsel appearing for the applicants submits that the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi has by its order dated 11.12.2015 prohibited registration of the aforementioned category of vehicles since they run on diesel fuel. Learned Counsel for the applicant submits that they had moved an application before the NGT for modification of its order but the NGT has declined to consider the same in view of the pendency of present proceedings before this Court. He submits that this Court could clarify that pendency of these proceedings in this Court shall not prevent the NGT from considering and making suitable orders for vacation/modification of its earlier orders so as to permit registration of the vehicles which the NDMC and SDMC use within their respective areas. We see no reason to decline that prayer. The NGT is permitted to suitably consider and pass appropriate orders by modification/vacation of its earlier orders in respect of the diesel vehicles which the NDMC and SDMC use for removal and transportation of solid waste in Delhi. These I.As. are disposed of with that observation,
