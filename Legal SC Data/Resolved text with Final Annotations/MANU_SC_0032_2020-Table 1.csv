Today everyone is concerned about level of pollution in Delhi and NCR region.,['Other'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is not something new, every year this kind of piquant situation arises for a substantial period.",['Other'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is compounded by the fact that year to year in spite of various directions issued by High Court, other authorities including this Court the State Governments, Government of NCT of Delhi and the corporations of Delhi and nearby States are not performing the corporations of Delhi and nearby States duties as enjoined upon the corporations of Delhi and nearby States.",['Fact'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a shocking state of affairs in which #Current Court# are put as on today.,['Fact'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is blatant and grave violation of right to life of the sizeable population by all these actions and the scientific data which has been pointed out indicates that life span of the people is being reduced by this kind of pollution which is being created and that people are being advised not to come back to Delhi or to leave Delhi Delhi due to severe pollution condition which has been created.,['Fact'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some burning in Western U.,['Other'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"P. also. some burning in Western U.P. also could not have taken place even in a singular district or gram panchayat area as #Current Court# live in a civilized country in which such kind of activities which create such menacing pollution not only in the area concerned but to the neighboring States also, by ill-effects of that people cannot be left to die or to suffer various ailments.",['Fact'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everybody has to be answerable including the top state machinery percolating down to the level of gram panchayat.,['Other'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"He has also pointed out that it would be appropriate to stop the use of diesel vehicle, in case it is necessitated as the diesel vehicles cause more pollution as compared to petrol and CNG vehicles.",['argument_respondant'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let the Government of NCT of Delhi explain this aspect and file the data in this regard in the Court on the basis of the previous experience and whether if three wheelers and taxies are plying more on road during such restriction and relevant data be placed.,['Conclusion'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
