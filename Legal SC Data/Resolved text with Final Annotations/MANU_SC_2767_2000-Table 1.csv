"B.N. Kirpal, J.",['Other'],,
"More in anguish, than out of anger, this Court nearly four years ago in Dr. B.L. Wadhera v #respondants# and Others MANU /SC/0773/1996 : [1996]3SCR80 observed: ""Historic city of Delhi - the capital of #respondants # - is one of the most polluted cities in the world.",['Fact'],,
"The authorities, responsible for pollution control and environment protection, have not been able to provide clean and healthy environment to the residents of Delhi.",['Fact'],,
The ambient air is so much polluted that The ambient air is difficult to breathe.,['Other'],,
More and more Delhi are suffering from respiratory diseases and throat infections.,['Other'],,
River Yamuna - the main source of drinking water supply - is the free dumping place for untreated sewage and industrial waste.,['Other'],,
"Apart from air and water pollution, Delhi is virtually an open dustbin.",['Other'],,
Garbage strewn all over Delhi is a common sight.,['Other'],,
"The Municipal #respondants# of Delhi (the #respondants#) constituted under the Delhi Municipal #respondants# Act, 1957 (Delhi Act) and the New Delhi Municipal Council (the #respondants#) constituted under the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (New Delhi Act) are wholly re-miss in the discharge of the New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994 (New Delhi Act) duties under law.",['Fact'],,
"It is no doubt correct that rapid industrial development, urbanisation and regular flow of persons from rural to urban areas have made major contribution towards environmental degradation but at the same time the authorities - entrusted with the work of pollution control - cannot be permitted to sit back with folded hands on the pretext that rapid industrial development, urbanisation and regular flow of persons from rural to urban areas have made major contribution towards environmental degradation have no financial or other means to control pollution and protect the environment.",['Other'],,
The Court then proceeded to issue 14 directions in an effort to see that the capital of the biggest democracy in the world is not branded as being one of the most polluted cities in the world.,['Fact'],,
It is indeed unfortunate that despite more than sufficient time having elapsed the condition of Delhi has not improved.,['Observation_finding'],,
"The citizens of Delhi increasingly suffer from respiratory and other diseases, the river Yamuna is highly polluted and garbage and untreated domestic and industrial waste is being either freely dumped into the river or is left on open land, large volume of which remains unattended.",['Other'],,
The present writ petition is concerned with the question of solid waste disposal.,['Legal_issues'],,
"By order dated 16th January, 1998 The Court The Court constituted a Committee headed by Mr. Asim Burmon to look into all aspects of urban solid waste management and in particular to the following four areas:",['Fact'],,
Examine the existing practices and to suggest hygienic processing and waste disposal practices and proven technologies on the basis of economic feasibility and safety which the #respondants#s/Government may directly or indirectly adopt or sponsor.,['Fact'],,
"Examine and suggest ways to improve conditions in the formal and informal sector for promoting eco-friendly sorting, collection, transportation, disposal, recycling and reuse.",['Fact'],,
"To review Municipal bye-laws and the powers of local bodies and regional planning authorities and suggest necessary #respondants#ifications to ensure effective budgeting, financing, administration, monitoring and compliance.",['Fact'],,
"Examine and formulate standard's and regulations for management of urban solid waste, and set time frame within which the authorities shall be bound to implement the same.",['Fact'],,
After a preliminary and then the final report of Jagmohan Committee was received notices were issued to all the #respondants# who were required to file notices responses to the report of Jagmohan Committee.,['Fact'],,
None of the #respondants# really opposed the recommendations made by Jagmohan Committee and Jagmohan Committee is noticed that the responses of the #respondants# were in fact positive.,['Fact'],,
"Keeping the final report of the said committee, Management of Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 1999 were notified by the Central Government which, as the heading itself suggests, deals with the question as to how the solid waste in the cities is to be managed and handled.",['Fact'],,
"In this Court's order dated 15th October, 1999 it was indicated that #Current Court# proposed to take up the question of cleaning of four metropolitan cities, namely, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Delhi as also the city of Bangalore.",['Fact'],,
#Current Court# have first heard counsel appearing on behalf of the #respondants# in connection with the management and handling of the solid waste.,['Fact'],,
It was in this connection that #Current Court#'s attention was drawn to the 14 directions issued by this Court in Dr. B.L. Wadhera's case [supra].,['Fact'],,
It is indeed unfortunate that till today the said directions have not been complied with.,['Observation_finding'],,
"When this was put to the #advocate_respondant# as to why the said directions were not complied with, there was, in effect, no satisfactory answer.",['Fact'],,
"For example, sites for landfill have not been identified and handed over to the #respondants# nor have four additional compost plant been constructed though specific direction in this regard was issued in Dr. B.L. Wadhera's case.",['Fact'],,
this Court also approved of the experimental scheme placed before this Court by the #respondants# where-under certain localities had been selected for distribution of polythene bags and collection of garbage from door to door but no effective progress appears to have been made in this regard.,['Fact'],,
These are but a few examples which show non-compliance of the directions issued.,['Other'],,
"#Current Court# are not oblivious of the fact that in a large city like Delhi where the floating population which comes in every day is not very small, keeping a large city like Delhi where the floating population which comes in every day is not very small clean is indeed a daunting task.",['Observation_finding'],,
Just because the work involved is difficult cannot be a reason for lack of initiative or inaction on the part of the authorities concerned.,['Other'],,
"#Current Court# are informed that one of the local authorities, namely, the #respondants# employ about forty thousand safai karamcharis.",['Observation_finding'],,
"This is in addition to the staff employed by other local bodies, namely, the #respondants# and the Cantonment Board.",['Fact'],,
"Like all government and municipal employees these karamcharis are expected to work for the stipulated period of time, namely, eight hours a day.",['Fact'],,
"It was submitted by #amicus_advocate# ant Dave, #amicus# that the in sanitary conditions of different areas of Delhi does not in any way show that requisite effort has been put in or the required time spent in the cleaning operations which are supposed to be carried out by this large workforce.",['argument_amicus'],,
These employees are more invisible than visible.,['Other'],,
"There appears to be a complete lack of accountability, at all levels of the #respondants#, in this behalf.",['Fact'],,
Keeping Delhi clean is not an easy task,['Other'],,
but then it is not an impossible one either.,['Other'],,
"What is required is initiative, selfless zeal and dedication and professional pride, elements which are sadly lacking here",['Other'],,
Surat had for time immemorial been known to be one of the dirtiest cities in Delhi.,['Other'],,
The plague there in 1995 was the result of the filth which had accumulated therein.,['Other'],,
"Nevertheless the effort of one man, namely, the Municipal Commissioner, who worked in the field and in the office with dedication resulted in not only eradicating the plague and cleaning up Surat but gave Surat Surat the distinction of being the second most clean city in the whole of #respondants#.",['Fact'],,
The people of Surat who threw garbage all around were so affected by the tireless effort of one person that The people of Surat who threw garbage all around have now become zealous guardians of The people of Surat who threw garbage all around newfound clean city of Surat.,['Other'],,
"This shows what one man as a head of the organisation, like Municipal #respondants#, with self less zeal, initiative and dedication and without allowing any outside interference can achieve by motivating his employees to clean up Surat while acting fairly, justly and efficiently within the four corners of the law.",['Fact'],,
In Delhi which is the capital of Delhi and which should be Delhi show piece,['Other'],,
no effective initiative of any kind has been taken by the numerous governmental agencies operating here in cleaning up Surat.,['Other'],,
"As a result thereof the Court had in Dr. B.L Wadhera's case, per force, to step in because of the non-performance or non-implementation of the law by the #respondants#. the law, inter alia, makes the law obligatory on The law, inter alia to discharge The law, inter alia municipal functions and at least prevent filth and garbage from lying strewn at different public places causing hazard to public health.",['Fact'],,
The local authorities are constituted for providing services to the citizens - not merely to provide employment to a few of employment inhabitants.,['Fact'],,
"Tolerating filth, while not taking action against the lethargic and inefficient workforce for fear of annoying the lethargic and inefficient workforce, is un-understandable and impermissible.",['Other'],,
Non-accountability has possibly led to lack of effort on the part of the employees concerned.,['Fact'],,
the employees concerned are perhaps sanguine in the employees,['Other'],,
concerned belief that non-performance is not frowned upon by #respondants# or by the heads of the organisations and no harm will befall the organisations.,['Fact'],,
Domestic garbage and sewage is a large contributor of solid waste.,['Other'],,
The drainage system in a city is intended to cope and deal with household effluent.,['Other'],,
This is so in a planned city.,['Other'],,
"But when a large number of inhabitants live in unauthorised colonies, with no proper means of dealing with the domestic effluents, or in slums with no care for hygiene the problem becomes more complex.",['Other'],,
"Establishment or creating of slums, it seems, appears to be good business and is well organised.",['Other'],,
a large number of inhabitants has multiplied in the last few years by geometrical proportion.,['Other'],,
"Large areas of public land, in this way, are usurped for private use free of cost.",['Other'],,
"It is difficult to believe that this can happen in the capital of the country without passive or active connivance of the land owning agencies and/or the #respondants#. The promise of free land, at the taxpayers' cost, in place of a jhuggi, is a proposal which attracts more land grabbers.",['Fact'],,
Rewarding an encroacher on public land with free alternate site is like giving a reward to a pickpocket.,['Other'],,
"The department of slum clearance does not seem to have cleared any slum despite The department of slum clearance's being in existence for decades, in fact more and more slums are coming into existence.",['Other'],,
Instead of 'Slum Clearance' there is 'Slum Creation' in Delhi.,['Fact'],,
This in turn gives rise to domestic waste being strewn on open land in and around the slums.,['Fact'],,
"This can best be controlled at least, in the first instance, by preventing the growth of slums.",['Other'],,
"The authorities must realise that there is a limit to which the population of a city can be increased, without enlarging it's size.",['Other'],,
In other words the density of population per square kilometer cannot be allowed to increase beyond the sustainable limit.,['Other'],,
Creation of slums resulting in increase in density has to be prevented.,['Other'],,
"What The department of slum clearance has to show, however, does not seem to be visible.",['Other'],,
The department of slum clearance is the garbage and solid waste generated by these slums which require to be dealt with most expeditiously and on the basis of priority.,['Other'],,
It was suggested by the #amicus# that #Current Court# should issue various directions to the #respondants# and the #respondants# including direction relating to the manner in which the solid waste generated in Delhi is to be handled.,['argument_amicus'],,
#Current Court# believe it is not for this Court to direct as to how the #respondants# should carry out the #respondants# functions and resolve difficulties in regard to the management of solid waste.,['Fact'],,
"this Court, in fact, is ill equipped to do so.",['Fact'],,
Without doubt #respondants#al agencies including the local authorities have all the powers of the State to take action and ensure that Delhi remains clean.,['Fact'],,
#respondants#al agencies including the local authorities have only to wake up and act.,['Fact'],,
"this Court should, however, direct that the local authorities, Government and all statutory authorities must discharge Government and all statutory authorities statutory duties and obligations in keeping Delhi at least reasonably clean.",['Fact'],,
#Current Court# propose to do so now by issuing appropriate directions.,['Fact'],,
Before #Current Court# pass the necessary orders some difficulties are stated to have been encountered in implementing some of the directions in Dr. B.L. Wadhera's case (supra) which need to be dealt with.,['Fact'],,
"One of the difficulties pointed out before #Current Court# was that even though the #respondants# and the #respondants# Acts permit action being taken, inter alia, against persons who litter Delhi sufficient number of judicial magistrates are not available for ensuring proper enforcement of the provisions of the said Acts.",['argument_respondant'],,
But the shortage of judicial magistrates can be easily overcome by #respondants# appointing suitable persons as Executive Magistrates under Section 20 or Special Executive Magistrates under Section 21 of the CrPC who can be empowered to deal with such minor offences under the provisions of the #respondants# and #respondants# Acts.,"['rationale', 'Fact']",,
"There are large number of retired government officials and ex-defence officers who have held responsible posts and are living in Delhi who, #Current Court# are sure, will be willing to act as such Magistrates.",['Conclusion'],,
Delhi is divided into a number of Municipal wards and for every ward one or more Executive Magistrate or Special Executive Magistrate can easily be appointed.,['Other'],,
This will also take some burden of the Courts.,['Conclusion'],,
The #advocate_respondant# has submitted that despite orders having been passed in Dr. B.L. Wadehra's case [supra] sufficient number of sites for landfills have neither been identified nor handed over to it.,['argument_respondant'],,
"One of the reasons for the sites not being made available, it was stated, was that land owning agencies like the DDA or #respondants# of #respondants# are demanding market value of the land of more than rupees forty lacs per acre before land can be transferred to the #respondants#. Keeping Delhi clean is a governmental function.",['Fact'],,
"There are more than one agencies that administer Delhi, namely, #respondants# through Ministry of Urban Development, Government of #respondants#, Commissioner of the #respondants#, Chairman, #respondants#, Cantonment Board and the DDA.",['Fact'],,
It is the duty of all concerned to see that landfill sites are provided in the interest of public health.,['Other'],,
"Providing of landfill sites is not a commercial venture, which is being undertaken by the #respondants#.",['Fact'],,
It is as much the duty of the #respondants# the #respondants# as that of other authorities enumerated above to see that sufficient sites for landfills to meet the requirement of Delhi for next twenty years are provided.,['Fact'],,
Not providing the same because the #respondants# the #respondants# is unable to pay an exorbitant amount is un-understandable.,['Fact'],,
Landfill site has to be provided and Landfill site is wholly immaterial which Governmental agency or the local authority has to pay the price for the price.,['Other'],,
"As for nearly four years since the direction was issued in Dr. B.L. Wadhera's case (supra) this problem has not been solved this problem has now become necessary for this Court this Court to issue appropriate directions in this behalf, which #Current Court# shall presently do.",['Conclusion'],,
One of the important directions issued in Dr. B.L Wadhera's case was regarding the construction of compost plants.,['Other'],,
"In addition to the compost plant at Okhla, which was expected to be in operation by 1st June, 1996, four additional compost plants were to be constructed, as recommended by Jagmohan Committee.",['Other'],,
This has not happened and even land for sufficient number of compost plants has not been identified or handed over.,['Other'],,
"This has, therefore, become necessary to issue time-bound directions in this be halt.",['Other'],,
Until now no action has been taken against people who spread litter.,['Other'],,
Discipline amongst people in this behalf has to be inculcated and the guilty punished.,['Other'],,
"Appropriate orders in this behalf are proposed to be issued including the appointment of Magistrates under Section 20 and/or Section 21 of the CrPC, inter alia, to deal with such cases.",['Other'],,
CONCLUSIONS:,['Other'],,
"In addition to and not in derogation of the orders passed by this Court in Dr. B.L. Wadhera's case (supra), #Current Court# order as follows:",['Conclusion'],,
