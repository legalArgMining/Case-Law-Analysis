"#Current Court# have heard the #advocate_respondant#, #amicus#, learned Counsel for the interveners who are manufacturers of vehicles (two wheelers, three wheelers, four wheelers and commercial vehicles - for short referred to as 'such vehicles') and learned Counsel for the association of dealers of such vehicles.",['Fact'],,
"The seminal issue in these applications is whether the sale and registration and therefore the commercial interests of manufacturers and dealers of such vehicles that do not meet the Bharat Stage-IV (for short 'BS-IV') emission standards as on 1st April, 2017 takes primacy over the health hazard due to increased air pollution of millions of #Current Court#'s country men and women.",['Legal_issues'],,
The answer is quite obvious.,['Other'],,
"The controversy relates to the sale and registration (on and after 1st April, 2017) of such vehicles lying in stock with the manufacturers and dealers that meet the Bharat Stage III emission standards (for short BS-III standards) but do not meet the BS-IV emission standards.",['Other'],,
"Briefly, according to the manufacturers, the manufacturers are entitled to manufacture such vehicles till 31st March, 2017 and the manufacturers have done so.",['Fact'],,
"In so doing, the manufacturers say that the manufacturers have not violated any prohibition or any law.",['Fact'],,
"Hence, the sale and registration of such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 ought not to be prohibited.",['Other'],,
"the sale and registration of such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 say that the sale and registration of such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 will not be manufacturing any vehicle that does not comply with the BS-IV emission standards from and after 1st April, 2017 and therefore the only issue is the sale and registration of the existing stock of such vehicles that comply with BS-III emission standards.",['Legal_issues'],,
"the sale and registration of such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 say that the sale and registration of such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 may be given reasonable time to dispose of the existing stock of such vehicles.",['Other'],,
"On the other hand, according to the #amicus#, permitting such vehicles to be sold or registered on or after 1st April, 2017 would constitute a health hazard to millions of #Current Court#'s country men and women by adding to the air pollution levels in the country (which are already quite alarming).",['argument_amicus'],,
"It is her submission that the manufacturers of such vehicles were fully aware, way back in 2010, that all vehicles would have to convert to BS-IV fuel on and from 1st April, 2017 and therefore, all vehicles had more than enough time to stop the production of BS-III compliant vehicles and switch over to the manufacture of BS-IV compliant vehicles.",['argument_amicus'],,
"In fact, the major manufacturer of 4 wheeler vehicles, Maruti Suzuki had completely switched over to the manufacture of BS-IV compliant vehicles a few years ago.",['Other'],,
"However, for reasons best known to manufacturers of such vehicles and entirely at manufacturers of such vehicles peril, manufacturers of such vehicles did not make a complete switch (though a partial switch has been made) even though manufacturers of such vehicles had the technology and technical know-how to do so.",['Other'],,
"Therefore, keeping the larger public interest in mind and the potential health hazard to millions of #Current Court#'s country men and women due to increased air pollution, there is no justification for any of the manufacturers not shifting to the manufacture of BS-IV compliant vehicles well before 1st April, 2017.",['Fact'],,
"It has been brought to #Current Court#'s notice that on 5th January, 2016 the #advocate_respondant# on behalf of the #respondants# had submitted before this Court that requisite quality fuel for BS-IV compliant vehicles would be available (all over the country) with effect from 1st April, 2017.1 This was confirmed and reiterated by the #advocate_respondant# during the course of hearing and the #advocate_respondant# stated that now from 1st April, 2017 requisite quality fuel for BS-IV compliant vehicles would be available all over the countrythe country.",['argument_respondant'],,
"the #advocate_respondant# also pointed out that the refineries of the #respondants# had incurred an expenditure of about Rs. 30,000 crores for producing requisite fuel for BS-IV compliant vehicles.",['argument_respondant'],,
"On balance, in #Current Court#'s opinion, the submission of the #amicus# deserves to be accepted keeping in mind the potential health hazard of such vehicles being introduced on the road affecting millions of #Current Court#'s people in the country.",['Observation_finding'],,
"The number of such vehicles may be small compared to the overall number of vehicles in the country but the health of the people is far, far more important than the commercial interests of the manufacturers or the loss that the people are likely to suffer in respect of the so-called small number of such vehicles.",['Other'],,
"The manufacturers of such vehicles were fully aware that eventually from 1st April, 2017 The manufacturers of such vehicles would be required to manufacture only BS-IV compliant vehicles but for reasons that are not clear, The manufacturers of such vehicles chose to sit back and declined to take sufficient pro-active steps.",['Other'],,
"Accordingly, for detailed reasons that will follow, #Current Court# direct that:",['Conclusion'],,
"(a) On and from 1st April, 2017 such vehicles that are not BS-IV compliant shall not be sold in #respondants# by any manufacturer or dealer, that is to say that such vehicles whether two wheeler, three wheeler, four wheeler or commercial vehicles will not be sold in #respondants# by any manufacturer or dealer on and from 1st April, 2017.",['Conclusion'],,
"(b) All the vehicle registering authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 are prohibited for registering such vehicles on and from 1st April, 2017 that do not meet BS-IV emission standards, except on proof that such a vehicle has already been sold on or before 31st March, 2017.",['Conclusion'],,
"As mentioned above, detailed reasons for the above order will be given in due course.",['Other'],,
