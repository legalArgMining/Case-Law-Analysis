The modification application is registered as I.A. No. 52448 of 2017 and #Current Court# now propose to decide The modification application.,['Fact'],,
"The background for that interim order passed on 11th November, 2016 is that Diwali was celebrated in 2016 on 30th October.",['Other'],,
"On the next day, it was discovered that PM2.5 levels in the air had crossed 700 æg/m3 being among the highest levels recorded in the world and about 29 times above the standards laid down by the World Health Organization (WHO).",['Other'],,
#Current Court# need not delve into the details given in that interim order since there is no dispute that the air in Delhi and in most parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) was stiflingly polluted.,['Fact'],,
This resulted in many falling sick and other having to purchase face masks for personal use and install air purifiers in buildings.,['Other'],,
The conclusion that the air in the NCR and particularly in Delhi was polluted is not only based on the above information but is also based on the statutory standards or the National Ambient Air Quality Standards laid down in #respondants#.,['Fact'],,
"the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are in Schedule VII of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.",['Other'],,
Broadly stated the presence of PM2.5 should range between 40 and 60 μg/m3 and the presence of PM10 should range between 60 and 100 æg/m3.,['Other'],,

"It is further stated that these industries directly employ about 2 lakh people and in addition, about 3 lakhs are employed in ancillary and subsidiary industries connected with the production and supply of fireworks.",['Other'],,
"According to The#appellants# the National Green Tribunal (NGT) rendered a decision on 10th November, 2016 in Original Application No. 21 of 2014 and other connected matters in which it is recorded that there are seven major contributors of air pollution in the NCR and these are:",['argument_appellant'],,
Construction activity and carriage of construction material.,['Other'],,
Burning of Municipal Solid Waste and other waste.,['Other'],,

Vehicular Pollution.,['Other'],,
Dust on the roads.,['Other'],,
Industrial and power house emission including fly-ash.,['Other'],,
Emissions from Hot-Mix Plants and Stone Crushers.,['Other'],,
"In other words, the submission of The#appellants# was that fireworks are not a major contributor of air pollution.",['argument_appellant'],,
"#Current Court# may, however, add that during the course of submissions, #Current Court# was accepted by learned Counsel for all the parties that whether or not the bursting of fireworks is a major cause of air pollution in the NCR, it is certainly one of the causes of air pollution, particularly in Delhi.",['Fact'],,
"The#appellants# also referred to and relied upon a study conducted by the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016.",['Fact'],,
"a study conducted by the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016 is titled ""Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases in Delhi"".",['Fact'],,
"a study conducted by the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016 was submitted in the form of a report to the Department of Environment of the Government of NCT of Delhi and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.",['Fact'],,
"a study conducted by the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016 suggests that the sources of PM2.5 are several but the bursting of fireworks is not one of the sources of PM2.5. ",['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# have not been informed whether any use has been made (if at all) of a study conducted by the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) in January 2016.",['Observation_finding'],,
"In addition to the aforesaid, The#appellants# also relied upon a view expressed by the #respondants# before this Court to the effect that poor wind speed was one of the causes of smog over Delhi particularly in the winter months.",['Fact'],,
"It was also submitted that there are certain other geographical and meteorological conditions such as temperature, wind direction and boundary layer that contribute to the presence of smog in Delhi.",['Other'],,
It was also submitted that the burning of crops or stubbles in Punjab and Pakistan also caused air pollution in Delhi and indeed this was the case in October-November 2016.,['Other'],,
"A reference was made to a brief write up along with an image, released by the Earth Observatory of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and dated 2nd November, 2016, stating that, ""Punjab ranks among the nation's top wheat and rice producers.",['Other'],,
"For a few weeks in October and November, Punjab also becomes a major producer of air pollution."" A reference was also made to a report in the New York Times by Geeta Anand on 2nd November, 2016 that an estimated 32 million tons of leftover straw from rice harvests were burnt in Punjab and Haryana, in spite of an NGT direction against this, and this led to plumes of smoke blackening the skies in the capital.",['Other'],,
The#appellants# drew #Current Court#'s attention to the poor air quality in Delhi on the days prior to Diwali 2016 and for more than a month thereafter.,['argument_appellant'],,
"A comparison was drawn with the air quality recorded by the #respondants# in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal to suggest that on some days prior to Diwali, the air quality was not particularly healthy in select cities in these States thereby suggesting that the air is generally polluted in different parts of these States and the bursting of fireworks may marginally add (if at all) to air pollution.",['Fact'],,
In this context this context was submitted that the bursting of fireworks takes place only for a couple of days around Diwali and other festive occasions and that cannot by this context result in a substantial deterioration in air quality all over these States.,['Other'],,
The bursting of fireworks around Diwali would have only a temporary and transitory impact and not any long lasting effect.,['Other'],,
"Therefore, The bursting of fireworks around Diwali does not explain high PM2.5 levels in Delhi more than even a month after Diwali.",['Other'],,
"During the course of submissions the course of submissions was pointed out that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had issued a direction on 8th November, 2016 under the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 banning the bursting of fireworks at all times except on religious occasions.",['Other'],,
the course of submissions was submitted that this ban is still in force and therefore this ban cannot be said that the terrible quality of air in Delhi in November 2016 and thereafter is attributable only to bursting of fireworks-there are several other factors.,['Other'],,
"the course of submissions was submitted that on an overall consideration of the issues, the ban and sale of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR should be modified if not lifted.",['Other'],,
#advocate_appellant#s gave #Current Court# a Note on the harmful and deleterious effects of some of the chemicals used in fireworks.,['argument_appellant'],,
"#Current Court# have no doubt and indeed #advocate_appellant#s had any doubt that the excessive use of chemicals in fireworks could have serious and deleterious health effects, particularly among children.",['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# are, therefore, proceeding on this basis without reference to the Note since there is no dispute on this aspect.",['Fact'],,
"With this agreement in mind (which has always been there), #Current Court# had passed an order on 31st July, 2017 after hearing learned Counsel as well as Dr. A. B. Akolkar, Member Secretary of the #respondants# and Mr. K. Sundershan, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, Sivakasi to the effect that fireworks manufactured by the#respondants# shall not contain antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in any form whatsoever. #Current Court# had also directed that #Current Court# would be the responsibility of PESO to ensure compliance particularly in Sivakasi. #Current Court# had noted that there was some doubt about the health hazards that could be caused by the use of strontium in fireworks and adjourned the matter to hear submissions in that regard.",['Fact'],,
Steps taken to reduce air pollution,['Other'],,
Learned Counsel for the parties drew #Current Court#'s attention to certain steps that have been taken to curb air pollution in Delhi around the time of Diwali.,['Fact'],,
"The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) had laid the foundation stone of the Fireworks Development Research Centre (FDRC) on 28th November, 2004.",['Other'],,

This study and research relates to the sound caused by the bursting of these fireworks and the light and colour emitted by these fireworks.,['Other'],,
No work has been done or study conducted at all with reference to pollution in the air caused by the bursting of these or other fireworks.,['Other'],,
#Current Court# were informed (somewhat faintly) that this is really the job of the #respondants# but the FDRC is willing to extend full cooperation to the #respondants# in arriving at some definite standards.,['Fact'],,
"It was also pointed out that this Court had passed an order on 18th July, 2005 in Noise Pollution (V), in Re. MANU/SC/0415/2005 : (2005) 5 SCC 733 to the following effect:",['Fact'],,
(i) Firecrackers,['Other'],,
"On a comparison of the two systems i.e. the present system of evaluating firecrackers on the basis of noise levels, and the other where Firecrackers",['Other'],,
"174 shall be evaluated on the basis of chemical composition, #Current Court# feel that the latter method is more practical and workable in #respondants#n circumstances.",['Fact'],,
It shall be followed unless and until replaced by a better system.,['Other'],,
DOE (DOE) shall undertake necessary research activity for the purpose and come out with the chemical formulae for each type or category or class of firecrackers.,['Other'],,
DOE shall specify the proportion/composition as well as the maximum permissible weight of every chemical used in manufacturing firecrackers.,['Other'],,
"DOE may divide the firecrackers into two categories-(i) sound-emitting firecrackers, and (ii) colour/light-emitting firecrackers.",['Other'],,
There shall be a complete ban on bursting sound-emitting firecrackers between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. It is not necessary to impose restrictions as to time on bursting of colour/light-emitting firecrackers.,['Other'],,
Every manufacturer shall on the box of each firecracker mention details of Every manufacturer chemical contents and that Every manufacturer satisfies the requirement as laid down by DOE.,['Other'],,
"In case of a failure on the part of Every manufacturer to mention the details or in cases where the contents of the box do not match the chemical formulae as stated on the box, Every manufacturer may be held liable.",['Other'],,
"Firecrackers for the purpose of export may be manufactured bearing higher noise levels subject to the following conditions: (i) Every manufacturer should be permitted to do so only when he has an export order with he and not otherwise; (ii) the noise levels for Firecrackers for the purpose of export should conform to the noise standards prescribed in the country to which Firecrackers for the purpose of export are intended to be exported as per the export order; (iii) Firecrackers for the purpose of export should have a different colour packing, from those intended to be sold in #respondants#; (iv) Firecrackers for the purpose of export must carry a declaration printed thereon something like ""not for sale in #respondants#"" or ""only for export to country AB"" and so on.",['Conclusion'],,
"But again these directions were confined to the sound (or noise), colour and light emitted by the bursting of fireworks and had no reference to air pollution.",['Other'],,
"#Current Court# were also informed that this Court had passed an order on 16th October, 2015 in the present petition to the following effect:",['Fact'],,

"(iii) Every manufacturer shall on the box of each fire cracker shall mention details of Every manufacturer chemical content, sound level and that Every manufacturer satisfies requirements as laid down by the Chief Controller.",['Other'],,
Fire-cracker meant for export shall have a different colour packing from those intended to be sold in #respondants# and a clear print indicating that they are not to be sold in #respondants#.,['Fact'],,
Sub-Rule 4 of Rule 15 of Rules is also of some importance and this reads as follows:,['Legal_Principles'],,
"(4) Marking on fireworks.- In case of fireworks, explosive composition, quantity of such composition, whether sound emitting crackers or colour or light emitting crackers, sound level, a caution or warning indicating the name of the item, manufacturer's name, method of firing and precautions to be taken both in words and pictorial view shall be printed on each piece of fireworks and cardboard box and where adequate space is not available on fireworks, such caution or warning shall be printed on a separate label and inserted in the smallest packet or carton.",['Other'],,
"Chapter VII of Rules relates to special provisions for possession, sale and use of explosives.",['Legal_Principles'],,
Rule 75 therein provides for a permit to be issued for temporary possession of manufactured fireworks in excess of the licensed quantity and this provides that a permit for a period not exceeding thirty days may be granted by the licensing authority to a licensee for fireworks shop to possess one-third in excess of the licensed quantity on receipt of the appropriate fees.,['Other'],,
Rule 84 of Rules provides for temporary shops for possession and sale of fireworks during festivals and this reads:,['Legal_Principles'],,
"Temporary shops for possession and sale of fireworks during festivals.-During festivals, the District Magistrate may issue temporary licences for possession and sale of fireworks in a temporary shop subject to the following conditions, namely:",['Other'],,
"(1) fireworks shall be kept in a shed made of non-flammable material, which is closed and secured so as to prevent unauthorised persons having access thereto.",['Other'],,
(2) The sheds for possession and sale of fireworks shall be at a distance of at least three metres from each other and fifty metres from any protected work.,['Other'],,
(3) The sheds shall not face each other.,['Other'],,
"(4) No oil burning lamps, gas lamps or naked lights shall be used in the shed or within the safety distance of The sheds.",['Other'],,
"Electrical lights, if used, shall be fixed to the wall or ceiling and shall not be suspended by flexible wire.",['Other'],,
Switches for each shop shall be fixed rigidly to the wall and a master switch shall be provided for each row of sheds.,['Other'],,
(5) Display of fireworks shall not be allowed within fifty metres of any shed.,['Other'],,
(6) In one cluster not more than fifty shops shall be permitted.,['Other'],,
"Chapter VIII of Rules relates to the grant or refusal of approval, no objection certificate, licence, certificates, amendment, transfer and renewal of licences.",['Legal_Principles'],,
"Rule 99 therein provides that licences and certificates, for a specific purpose may be granted by the authorities, specified in Part 1 of Schedule IV of Rules.",['Legal_Principles'],,
Rule 9(5) provides for the period of validity of the licence granted under Rule 9(5) while Rule 9(5) provides for documents to be furnished for approval and grant of a licence and the relevant Form required to be filled up by an#appellants#.,['Legal_Principles'],,
"Schedule IV referred to in Rule 99 of Rules, particularly Part 1 thereof is required to be read with Rule 113 of Rules and from a perusal of items 5 and 6 thereof, the limits for possession and sale of fireworks, the relevant licensing application form and the licensing authority are indicated.",['Legal_Principles'],,
"#advocate_appellant# informed #Current Court# through a note that as of date, in the NCR, PESO has issued 435 permanent licences and in Delhi alone, PESO has issued 175 permanent licences, thereby making a total of 610 permanent licences.",['argument_appellant'],,
"It is further stated that the stocks in hand of the fireworks in the NCR both under permanent and temporary licences is 50,00,000 kg in the NCR and 1,00,000 kg in Delhi.",['Other'],,
What more needs to be done,['Other'],,
What is necessary now is to correlate air pollution with the sale and bursting of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR.,['Other'],,
There is no doubt that the air #Current Court# breathe gets polluted with the bursting of fireworks.,['Fact'],,
"The extent of air pollution caused by bursting fireworks is not clear in the absence of empirical data-it could be severe or it could be marginal, but it is there.",['Other'],,
Have the steps already taken by the concerned authorities reduced air pollution during Diwali?,['Other'],,
"It seems to #Current Court# that the steps so far taken by the Government of NCT of Delhi are limited to issuing directions, which is merely paperwork.",['Observation_finding'],,
Only general directions have been given in the past to schools to sensitize the students and the staff as to the ill-effects and health hazards of bursting fireworks.,['Other'],,
No specific plan of action has been laid down by the Government of NCT of Delhi NCT of Delhi to make children aware of the hazards of bursting fireworks and the existing awareness campaigns have been allowed to drift over the last one year.,['Other'],,
There is no information on the success or failure of the existing awareness campaigns.,['Other'],,
The response of the Government of NCT of Delhi NCT of Delhi is lethargic with the absence of any keenness to take proactive steps.,['Other'],,
This is disconcerting.,['Other'],,
This is high time that governmental authorities realize that the cost of ill health (particularly among children) is far greater in psycho-social terms than in financial and economic terms.,['Other'],,
The adage that 'prevention is better than cure' is fully applicable in the present circumstances.,['Other'],,
"Similarly, the #respondants# has issued directions that are difficult to enforce such as restricting the time during which fireworks can be burst.",['Fact'],,
These are ad hoc measures that might be workable (if at all) only for the immediate future.,['Other'],,
#Current Court# have not been informed of the impact of such directions or #Current Court# implementation.,['Observation_finding'],,
#Current Court# must note that there has been no response from the States within the NCR giving the impression that air pollution is not a problem for the State Governments despite the ill-effects and health hazards of bursting fireworks.,['Observation_finding'],,
"There must be a concerted effort by the powers that be to ensure awareness and sensitization of the people in Delhi and NCR, particularly children, of the health hazards of indiscriminate use of fireworks.",['Other'],,
"Unless urgent steps are taken, there could be an adverse impact on the health of children and this would be to nobody's benefit but to everybody's detriment.",['Other'],,
Anybody who lived in Delhi during Diwali in 2016 and soon thereafter would have experienced the choking effects of breathing in polluted air and the tremendous increase in the use and sale of face masks and air purifiers.,['Other'],,
"In the absence of any concerted plan of action implemented by the governmental authorities, the residents responded in an ad hoc manner by purchasing face masks and air purifiers.",['Other'],,
There is no doubt that an effective and longer lasting solution is necessary.,['Other'],,
"What has really disturbed #Current Court# is that the #respondants# was directed on 11th November, 2016 to study and prepare a report within three months on the harmful effects of the materials used in the manufacture of fireworks.",['Fact'],,
It is astonishing that the #respondants# has not conducted the study and prepared a report as directed.,['Observation_finding'],,
"Apart from the fact that the #respondants# has not conducted any study, even otherwise, no standards have been laid down by the #respondants# which could give any indication of the acceptable and permissible limit of constituent metals or chemicals used in fireworks and released in the air, beyond which their presence would be harmful or dangerous.",['Fact'],,
There cannot be any doubt that the presence of certain metals or chemicals in the air beyond a particular limit would be inadvisable but that limit is not known to anybody including the #respondants#.,['Fact'],,
"Therefore, any discussion on the subject of whether there is an excessive presence of a particular chemical in the air will not yield any result unless some authority lays down an acceptable standard of what is excessive and what is not.",['Other'],,
"Dr. Akolkar, Member Secretary of the #respondants# had informed #Current Court# on 31st July, 2017 that the #respondants# would be in a position to lay down the standards by 15th September, 2017.",['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# do hope the #respondants# does so-in any case as a part of the continuing mandamus principle laid down by this Court, the matter is required to be followed up.",['Fact'],,
"What is also worrying, apart from the absence of standards or limits having been laid down by the #respondants#, is that very little or no attention seems to have been paid by any of the governmental authorities to the possible health hazards faced by children due to exposure to chemicals in fireworks.",['Fact'],,
the governmental authorities need to realize the governmental authorities responsibility regarding the care and protection of the health of the people in Delhi and NCR and the importance of launching a sustained campaign to reduce air pollution to manageable limits during Diwali and the period immediately thereafter.,['Other'],,
The health of children should be of foremost concern in this regard.,['Other'],,
"It is, as submitted, only a matter of a few days of intense pollution but even that is capable of having long term health effects.",['Other'],,
"There are also short-term adverse consequences of breathing in polluted air and even this cannot be overlooked by the governmental authorities, particularly in the case of children.",['Other'],,
"On 31st July, 2017 #Current Court# had prohibited the use of five chemicals and #Current Court# compounds in the manufacture of fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"These constituents are antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead.",['Other'],,
#Current Court# # had left open the issue of use of strontium and #Current Court# compounds in the manufacture of fireworks.,['Fact'],,
"During the course of submissions on the issue of whether the use of strontium should be permitted in fireworks and the application for modification or vacation of the interim order, #Current Court#'s attention was drawn to an Article in the Swarajya magazine, by one Srikanth Ramakrishnan who reported that the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) along with researchers from an organization based in Austria, namely, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIAS) had conducted a study whose results revealed that the majority of the pollution in Delhi comes from outside the NCT of Delhi and from other areas in the NCR in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.",['Fact'],,
"Therefore, no matter what air quality standards are adopted in Delhi, pollution would flow in from the neighbouring States in any case.",['Other'],,
The report prepared by NEERI and the IIAS has not been made available to #Current Court# .,['Fact'],,
"Be that as it may, the #respondants# has now concluded that only strontium chromate is harmful or dangerous to human health.",['Fact'],,
"Therefore, #Current Court# have no option but to prohibit the use of strontium chromate in the manufacture of fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"It was submitted by #advocate_respondant#, learned Counsel appearing for one of the#respondants# that the best possible solution to the problem of air pollution in Delhi, allegedly due to the bursting of fireworks, would be to constitute a Committee to advise this Court.",['argument_respondant'],,
"It was submitted that when the issue of noise pollution had surfaced, the #respondants# had set up the National Committee on Noise Pollution and Control in 1997 which led to noise pollution standards being set.",['Fact'],,
It was suggested that a similar exercise may be undertaken to deal with the issue of air pollution due to bursting of fireworks in Delhi.,['Other'],,
"This was precisely the purpose of issuing a direction to the #respondants# on 11th November, 2016 but that was not taken seriously.",['Fact'],,
"Therefore, in #Current Court#'s opinion, the suggestion deserves acceptance and the suggestion is necessary to set up such a Committee with the assistance and guidance of the #respondants# and the FDRC.",['Observation_finding'],,
such a Committee can quite effectively conduct a study along with assistance and inputs from other bodies or organizations and make recommendations.,['Other'],,
"It may be appropriate to appoint a such a Committee including officers at the appropriate level from the National Physical Laboratory, Delhi, the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, the #respondants#n Institute of Technology, Kanpur, scientists from the State Pollution Control Boards, the Fire Development and Research Centre, Sivakasi and Nagpur and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).",['Fact'],,
"It was submitted by #advocate_appellant#s that the poor air quality in November 2016 justified the passing of the interim order on 11th November, 2016 and there was no reason to vary that order.",['argument_appellant'],,
Virulent air pollution is a cause of concern and the only remedy to stop Virulent air pollution ill effects is to continue the suspension of licences for the sale of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR.,['Other'],,
"It was submitted that if there is any doubt regarding the effect of bursting fireworks on air pollution, and in the absence of any standards to measure the same, the safer course would be to continue such suspension rather than risk the health of large Sections of people in Delhi and the NCR, particularly children.",['Other'],,
"It was submitted by #advocate_appellant#s the#appellants#s that in Consumer Education & Research Centre v #respondants# MANU/SC/0175/1995 : (1995) 3 SCC 42 it was held by this Court that the right to health, though of a worker, is a fundamental right.",['argument_appellant'],,
"#Current Court# see no real difference between the fundamental right to health of a worker and the human right to health of any other citizen of the country, particularly children who perhaps need more care and attention.",['Fact'],,
It was held in paragraph 24 of the Report:,['Other'],,
"The right to health to a worker is an integral facet of meaningful right to life, to have not only a meaningful existence but also robust health and vigour without which worker would lead life of misery.",['Legal_Principles'],,
Lack of health denudes him of him livelihood.,['Other'],,
"Compelling economic necessity to work in an industry exposed to health hazards due to indigence to bread-winning for him and him dependants, should not be at the cost of the health and vigour of the workman.",['Other'],,
"Facilities and opportunities, as enjoined in Article 38, should be provided to protect the health of the workman.",['Other'],,
Provision for medical test and treatment invigorates the health of the worker for higher production or efficient service.,['Other'],,
"Continued treatment, while in service or after retirement is a moral, legal and constitutional concomitant duty of the employer and the State.",['Other'],,
"Therefore, it must be held that the right to health and medical care is a fundamental right Under Article 21 read with Articles 39(e), 41 and 43 of the Constitution and make the life of the workman meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person.",['Legal_Principles'],,
Right to life includes protection of the health and strength of the worker and is a minimum requirement to enable a person to live with human dignity.,['Legal_Principles'],,
A similar view was expressed in Occupational Health & Safety Assn.,['Other'],,
v #respondants# MANU/SC/0076/2014 : (2014) 3 SCC 547 when it was held in paragraph 10 of the Report:,['Fact'],,
"Right to health i.e. right to live in a clean, hygienic and safe environment is a right flowing from Article 21.",['Legal_Principles'],,
Clean surroundings lead to healthy body and healthy mind.,['Other'],,
"But, unfortunately, for eking out a livelihood and for national interest, many employees work in dangerous, risky and unhygienic environment.",['Other'],,
"Right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the directive principles of State policy, particularly Clauses (e) and (f) of Articles 39, 41 and 42.",['Other'],,
Those articles include protection of health and strength of workers and just and humane conditions of work.,['Other'],,
Those are minimum requirements which must exist to enable a person to live with human dignity.,['Other'],,
Every State has an obligation and duty to provide at least the minimum condition ensuring human dignity.,['Other'],,
"Under the circumstances, there can be no doubt that the residents of the NCT of Delhi and indeed the NCR are entitled to breathe unpolluted air.",['Other'],,
the residents of the NCT of Delhi and indeed the entire NCR are entitled to breathe unpolluted air are entitled to the protection of the residents of the NCT of Delhi and indeed the entire NCR are entitled to breathe unpolluted air health from the adverse consequences of breathing in air polluted by the bursting of fireworks.,['Other'],,
The right to breathe clean air is a recognized right under #Current Court#'s Constitution.,['Fact'],,
#advocate_appellant#s the#appellants#s drew #Current Court#'s attention to paragraphs 16 and 17 of Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v #respondants# MANU/SC/0686/1996 : (1996) 5 SCC 647 which read as follows:,['Fact'],,
"The constitutional and statutory provisions protect a person's right to fresh air, clean water and pollution-free environment, but the source of the right is the inalienable common law right of clean environment.",['Other'],,
It would be useful to quote a paragraph from Blackstone's commentaries on the Laws of England (Commentaries on the Laws of England of Sir William Blackstone) Vol.,['Other'],,
"III, fourth edition published in 1876.",['Other'],,
"Chapter XIII, ""Of Nuisance"" depicts the law on the subject in the following words:",['Other'],,
"Also, if a person keeps a person hogs, or other noisome animals, or allows filth to accumulate on a person premises, so near the house of another, that the stench incommodes a person and makes the air unwholesome, this is an injurious nuisance, as it tends to deprive a person of the use and benefit of a person house.",['Other'],,
"A like injury is, if one's neighbour sets up and exercises any offensive trade; as a tanner's, a tallow-chandler's, or the like; for though these are lawful and necessary trades, yet these should be exercised in remote places; for the Rule is, 'sic utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas'; this therefore is an actionable nuisance.",['Other'],,
And on a similar principle a constant ringing of bells in one's immediate neighbourhood may be a nuisance.,['Other'],,
...,['Other'],,
"With regard to other corporeal hereditaments; it is a nuisance to stop or divert water that used to run to another's meadow or mill; to corrupt or poison a watercourse, by erecting a dye-house or a lime-pit, for the use of trade, in the upper part of the stream; to pollute a pond, from which another is entitled to water his cattle; to obstruct a drain; or in short to do any act in common property, that in common property consequences must necessarily tend to the prejudice of one's neighbour.",['Other'],,
"So closely does the law of England enforce that excellent Rule of gospel-morality, of 'doing to others, as #Current Court# would others should do unto ourselves'.",['Fact'],,
Our legal system having been founded on the law of England the right of a person to a pollution-free environment is a part of the basic jurisprudence of the land.,['Other'],,
"The right to health coupled with the right to breathe clean air leaves no manner of doubt that it is important that air pollution deserves to be eliminated and one of the possible methods of reducing it is important that air pollution deserves to be eliminated during Diwali is by continuing the suspension of licences for the sale of fireworks and therefore implicitly, prohibiting the bursting of fireworks.",['Legal_Principles'],,
"In #Current Court#'s considered opinion, continuing the suspension of licences might be too radical a step to take for the present-a graded and balanced approach is necessary that will reduce and gradually eliminate air pollution in Delhi and in the NCR caused by the bursting of fireworks.",['Observation_finding'],,
At the same time it is necessary to ensure that injustice is not caused to those who have already been granted a valid permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks in Delhi and the NCR.,['Other'],,
The graded and balanced approach is not intended to dilute #Current Court#'s primary concern which is and remains the health of everybody and the human right to breathe good quality air or at least not be compelled to breathe poor quality air.,['Fact'],,
"Generally speaking, this must take precedence over the commercial or other interest of the#appellants# and those granted a permanent licence to possess and sell fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"But, from the material before us, it cannot be said with any great degree of certainty that the extremely poor quality of air in Delhi in November and December 2016 was the result only of bursting fireworks around Diwali.",['Observation_finding'],,
"Certainly, there were other causes as well, but even so the contribution of the bursting of fireworks cannot be glossed over.",['Other'],,
"Unfortunately, neither is it possible to give an accurate or relative assessment of the contribution of the other identified factors nor the contribution of bursting fireworks to the poor air quality in Delhi and in the NCR.",['Other'],,
"Consequently, a complete ban on the sale of fireworks would be an extreme step that might not be fully warranted by the facts available to #Current Court# .",['Fact'],,
"There is, therefore, some justification for modifying the interim order passed on 11th November, 2016 and lifting the suspension of the permanent licences.",['Other'],,
"At the same time, it cannot be forgotten that admittedly there is a huge quantity of fireworks in Delhi and in the NCR and the figure has been provided to #Current Court# by the#appellants#.",['Fact'],,
"Similarly, there can be no doubt that the #respondants# had issued a large number of temporary licences in 2016 and it would not be unreasonable to assume that around and during Diwali, there would have been some illegal temporary shops set up, whether known or not known to the police.",['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# do not have the figures with regard to the NCR, but #Current Court# assume that like in Delhi, a large number of temporary licences have been issued for the possession and sale of fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"Therefore, there is a need to regulate the availability and sale of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR.",['Other'],,
Directions,['Other'],,
"As mentioned above, the health of the people in Delhi and NCR must take precedence over any commercial or other interest of the#appellants# or any of the permanent licensees and, therefore, a graded Regulation is necessary which would eventually result in a prohibition.",['Fact'],,
"Taking all factors into consideration, #Current Court# are of the view that the following orders and directions are required to be issued and #Current Court# do so:",['Fact'],,
(1) The directions issued by this Court in Sadar Bazar Fire Works (Pucca Shop) Association3 shall stand partially modified to the extent that The directions issued by this Court in Sadar Bazar Fire Works (Pucca Shop) Association3 are not in conformity with the Explosives Rules which shall be implemented in full by the concerned authorities.,['Fact'],,
Safety from fire hazards is one of #Current Court#'s concerns in this regard.,['Fact'],,
"(2) Specifically, Rule 15 relating to marking on explosives and packages and Rule 84 relating to temporary shops for possession and sale of fireworks during festivals of the Explosives Rules shall be strictly enforced.",['Legal_Principles'],,
This should not be construed to mean that the other the Explosives Rules need not be enforced-all Rules should be enforced.,['Legal_Principles'],,
"But if the fireworks do not conform to the requirements of Rules 15 and 84, they cannot be sold in the NCR, including Delhi and this prohibition is absolute.",['Other'],,
"(3) The directions issued and restrictions imposed in the order passed by this Court on 18th July, 2005 in Noise Pollution (V) shall continue to be in force.",['Fact'],,
"(4) The concerned police authorities and the District Magistrates will ensure that fireworks are not burst in silence zones that is, an area at least 100 meters away from hospitals, nursing homes, primary and district health-care centres, educational institutions, courts, religious places or any other area that may be declared as a silence zone by the concerned authorities.",['Other'],,
(5) the #respondants# is directed to reduce the grant of temporary licences by about 50% of the number of licences granted in 2016.,['Fact'],,
The number of temporary licences should be capped at 500.,['Other'],,
"Similarly, the #respondants# are restrained from granting more than 50% of the number of temporary licences granted in 2016.",['Fact'],,
The area of distribution of the temporary licences is entirely for the authorities to decide.,['Other'],,
"(6) The #respondants# will ensure strict compliance with the Notification GSR No. 64(E) dated 27th January, 1992 regarding the ban on import of fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"The #respondants# is at liberty to update and revise the Notification in view of the passage of time and further knowledge gained over the last 25 years and issue a fresh notification, if necessary.",['Fact'],,
"(7) The Department of Education of the Government of NCT of Delhi and the corresponding Department in other #respondants# shall immediately formulate a plan of action, in not more than 15 days, to reach out to children in all the schools through the school staff, volunteers and NGOs to sensitize and educate school children on the health hazards and ill-effects of breathing polluted air, including air that is polluted due to fireworks.",['Fact'],,
"School children should be encouraged to reduce, if not eliminate, the bursting of fireworks as a part of any festivities.",['Other'],,
(8) The Government of NCT of Delhi and other #respondants# the NCR may consider interacting with established medical institutions for issuing advisories cautioning people about the health hazards of bursting fireworks.,['Fact'],,
"(9) The interim direction issued by this Court on 31st July, 2017 prohibiting the use of compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in the manufacture of fireworks is made absolute.",['Fact'],,
"In addition, the use of strontium chromate in the manufacture of fireworks is prohibited.",['Other'],,
"(10) Fireworks containing aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium may be sold in Delhi and in the NCR, provided the composition already approved by PESO is maintained.",['Other'],,
PESO is the responsibility of PESO to ensure compliance of the standards PESO has formulated.,['Other'],,
"(11) Since there are enough fireworks available for sale in Delhi and the NCR, the transport of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR from outside the region is prohibited and the concerned law enforcement authorities will ensure that there is no further entry of fireworks into Delhi and the NCR till further orders.",['Other'],,
"In #Current Court#'s opinion, even 50,00,000 kg of fireworks is far more than enough for Dussehra and Diwali in 2017.",['Observation_finding'],,
"The permanent licensees are at liberty to exhaust The permanent licensees existing stock of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR and, if that is not possible, take measures to transport the stocks outside Delhi and the NCR.",['Other'],,
"(12) The suspension of permanent licences as directed by the order dated 11th November, 2016 is lifted for the time being.",['Other'],,
This might require a review after Diwali depending on the ambient air quality post Diwali.,['Other'],,
"However, This is made explicit that the sale of fireworks by The permanent licensees must conform to the directions given above and must be fully in compliance with the Explosives Rules.",['compliance'],,
#Current Court# were informed that the permanent licences were issued by PESO and therefore the responsibility is on PESO to ensure compliance.,['Fact'],,
"(13) While lifting the suspension on the permanent licences already granted, #Current Court# put these licensees on notice for Dussehra and Diwali in 2018 that they will be permitted to possess and sell only 50% of the quantity permitted in 2017 and that this will substantially reduce over the next couple of years.",['Fact'],,
The permanent licensees are at liberty to file objections to this proposed direction within 30 days from today and thereafter the objections if any will be heard and decided.,['Other'],,
"If no objections are filed, this proposed direction will become absolute without any further reference to any licensee.",['Other'],,
"(14) Since there is a lack of clarity on the safety limits of various metals and constituents used in fireworks, a research study must be jointly carried out by the #respondants# and the FDRC laying down appropriate standards for ambient air quality in relation to the bursting of fireworks and the release of their constituents in the air.",['Fact'],,
"While Schedule VII of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 does deal with several metals, but as #Current Court# have seen there are several other metals or constituents of fireworks that have not been studied by the #respondants# and no standards have been laid down with regard to the concentration of these metals or constituents in the ambient air.",['Fact'],,
"the #respondants# has assured #Current Court# that the #respondants# will complete the exercise by 15th September, 2017 but keeping in mind the #respondants# track record subsequent to the order dated 11th November, 2016 this does not seem possible.",['Fact'],,
"Therefore, #Current Court# grant time to the #respondants# to come out with definite standards on or before 30th September, 2017.",['Conclusion'],,
"(15) In any event, a research study also needs to be conducted on the impact of bursting fireworks during Dussehra and Diwali on the health of the people.",['Other'],,
"We, therefore, appoint a Committee to be chaired by the Chairperson of the #respondants# and consisting of officers at the appropriate level from the National Physical Laboratory, Delhi, the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, the #respondants#n Institute of Technology-Kanpur, scientists from the State Pollution Control Boards, the Fire Development and Research Centre, Sivakasi and Nagpur and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) nominated by the Chairperson of the #respondants# to submit a report in this regard preferably on or before 31st December, 2017.",['Fact'],,
"(16) Keeping in mind the adverse effects of air pollution, the human right to breathe clean air and the human right to health, the #respondants# and other authorities should consider encouraging display fireworks through community participation rather than individual bursting of fireworks.",['rationale'],,
