Regular community level awareness programmes may be organized in the vicinity of the plant for the family members of the workers.,['Other'],,
"• Periodic medical examination (PME), as required under the Factories Act should be undertaken.",['Other'],,
"However, the investigations performed under the PME should be relevant to the job exposures.",['Other'],,
"Since coal/ash handling workers are prone to dust exposure related diseases, due attention is required to coal/ash handling workers.",['Other'],,
"In case of need, the frequency of the PME may be scheduled, based on observation of the health check-up information.",['Other'],,
Providing PPE and re-locating of job for coal/ash handling workers may also be considered.,['Other'],,
"• As per recommendations of the Factories Act, coal/ash handling workers need to be examined radiologically (chest X-ray) on yearly basis.",['Other'],,
"However, in order to avoid unnecessary exposure of the human body to the radiation, the regular yearly chest X-ray is not recommended, unless urgent and essential.",['Other'],,
"Considering the latency period of development of pneumoconiosis, the latency period of development of pneumoconiosis is recommended to undergo chest X-ray every two years for initial 10 years and based on the progression, re-scheduling may be adopted.",['Other'],,

"After dealing with those health hazards, the Committee of Experts has stated that the hazards associated with inhalation of coal dust might result in development of dust related morbidity in the form of pneumoconiosis (coal workers pneumoconiosis, silicosis) and non-pneumoconiosis persistent respiratory morbidities, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, etc.",['Other'],,
"Further, the Committee of Experts also pointed out that whenever asbestos fibres are used for insulation and other purposes, the possibility of asbestosis among workers due to inhalation of asbestos fibres cannot be ruled out.",['Other'],,
"the above-mentioned Report also says that other morbidities because of exposure to fly ash, including metallic constituents such as lead, arsenic, and mercury might also be present.",['Other'],,
"Due to exposure to other chemicals used in different operations of CFTPP, the above-mentioned Report says, may also be responsible to adversely affect human health.",['Other'],,
"the above-mentioned Report further says that occupational exposure to high heat in different thermal power plants may also cause heat related disorders, like heat exhaustion.",['Other'],,

Radiation hazards particularly from the generated fly ash and its used products have also been indicated of possible health risks.,['Other'],,
"Different chemicals that are often being used in CFTPPs, such as chlorine, ammonia, fuel oil, and released in the working and community environment may be responsible for wide range of acute as well as chronic health impairments.",['Other'],,
"Since large quantities of coal, other fuels and chemicals are stored and used in new CFTPPs, the risks of fire and explosion are high, unless special care is taken in handling the materials.",['Other'],,
It may cause fire and explosion.,['Other'],,
"Further, It may also be pointed out that in various work operations for manual materials handling, the workers are subjected to high degree of physical stress, with potential risks of musculo-skeletal disorders and injuries.",['Other'],,

#Current Court# feel that these aspects could be better examined by the respective High Courts in whose jurisdiction these power plants are situated.,['Fact'],,
this Court should examine whether there is adequate and effective health delivery system in place and whether there is any evaluation of occupational health status of the workers.,['Conclusion'],,
this Court should also examine whether any effective medical treatment is meted out to any effective medical treatment.,['Conclusion'],,
"We, therefore, feel that it is appropriate to relegate it to the various High Courts to examine these issues with the assistance of the State Governments after calling for necessary Reports from new CFTPPs situated in the assistance of the State Governments respective States.",['Other'],,
