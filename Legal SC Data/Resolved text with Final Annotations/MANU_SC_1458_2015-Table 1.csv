"#Current Court# had by #Current Court#'s order dated 9th October, 2015 issued certain directions, aimed at mitigating the hardship which the people living in Delhi undergo having regard to the high of pollution in the city that has earned to #Current Court# the dubious reputation of being the most polluted city in the world.",['Fact'],,
#Current Court# had among others directed the following measures to be taken:,['Fact'],,
(1) The #respondants# shall take steps to ensure that commercial traffic for destinations other than Delhi use alternative routes and to ensure that in the course of implementation of the said direction no traffic jams and other inconvenience is caused to the public.,['Fact'],,
(2) The #respondants# shall direct issue advertisements to inform commercial traffic of the bypass routes and the imposition of the ECC imposed by this Court for entry of the vehicles into Delhi.,['Fact'],,
"(3) The toll collectors shall put in place Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems at The toll collectors own costs at nine main entry points in the city by November 30, 2015 and by 31st January, 2016 at all the remaining 118 entry points to the city.",['Other'],,
The #respondants# shall install The #respondants# own CCTV cameras at nine entry points and also organise surprise visits to oversee the collection of ECC and other necessary arrangements.,['Fact'],,
#Current Court# had by the same order directed levy and collection of ECC at the following rates:,['Fact'],,
(i) The Category 2 (light duty vehicles etc.) and Category 3 (2 axle trucks) at the rate of Rs. 700/- per vehicle;,['Other'],,
(ii) Category 4 (3 axle trucks) and Category 5 (4 axle trucks and above) at the rate of Rs. 1300/- per truck.,['Other'],,
"Passenger vehicles, ambulances and vehicles carrying essential commodities like food stuffs and oil tankers for Delhi were exempted from the above charges.",['Other'],,
"Mr. #amicus_advocate#, learned senior Counsel appearing as#amicus#, argued that imposition of ECC and the directions issued by this Court regarding diversion of commercial vehicles/trucks to alternative routes has made some difference but the pollution levels continue to remain high despite such measures.",['argument_amicus'],,
"Mr. #amicus_advocate# submitted by reference to the material placed on record that the level of pollution detected on or before 9th October, 2015 was infact lower than the levels recorded on subsequent dates.",['argument_amicus'],,
"Mr. #amicus_advocate# further submitted that although diversion of vehicles to alternative routes in terms of the order passed by this Court was given effect to belatedly on 6th November, 2015, yet the said direction has not been effectively enforced inasmuch as vehicles not bound for Delhi are being allowed to enter Delhi on payment of the prescribed ECC.",['argument_amicus'],,
It was submitted that the true spirit of the order passed by this Court was that vehicles that were bound for Delhi were to enter Delhi and other vehicles bound for other destinations/cities were supposed to bypass Delhi by using alternative routes.,['argument_amicus'],,
Mr. #amicus_advocate# drew #Current Court#'s attention to a similar direction issued by this Court in #appellants# v #respondants# and Others (2003) 10 SCC 561.,['argument_amicus'],,
"It was in that view urged that the order passed by this Court on 9th October, 2015 could be modified/clarified to make it clear that the #respondants# shall take steps to divert vehicles that are not bound for Delhi through alternative routes especially those using National Highway-8 and National Highway-1 for entering the national capital.",['Fact'],,
"It was also contended by Mr. #amicus_advocate# that in order to effectively discourage vehicles from entering Delhi, the prescribed ECC could be revised upwards especially when the #respondants#, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the #respondants# were all agreeable to the same.",['argument_amicus'],,
"#advocate_respondant#, #advocate_respondant# appearing for the #respondants#, submitted that diversion of traffic away from Delhi by use of alternative routes as also by way of enhancement of the prescribed ECC has been thoroughly discussed with the #amicus# and that the #respondants# and so also the Government of NCT have no objection to such a direction being issued.",['argument_respondant'],,
"#advocate_respondant# submitted that as a matter of fact discussions held between the representatives of the two governments, namely, #respondants# and #respondants# as also the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had led to a consensus on five other points also on which this Court could issue suitable directions to help reduce the pollution levels in Delhi.",['argument_respondant'],,
this Court was submitted that the revision of the prescribed ECC could be upto 100% of the amount already stipulated for vehicles that are Delhi bound while other vehicles which are not bound for Delhi could be directed to bypass Delhi by using alternative routes which the two governments could be directed to specify.,['Fact'],,
"By #Current Court#'s order dated 6th December, 2001 passed in #appellants# v #respondants# and Others (2003) 10 SCC 561, #Current Court# had, inter alia, directed:",['Fact'],,
"10 SCC 561, #Current Court# appears that vehicles which transit through Delhi do not adhere to the vehicular standards which are applicable in Delhi, namely, vehicles which transit through Delhi are not Euro II-compliant nor are vehicles which transit through Delhi using low sulphur and low benzene fuel.",['Fact'],,
There is no reason why very large number of goods vehicles should transit through Delhi thereby adding to the pollution level and the traffic on the road.,['Other'],,
"It is, therefore, proposed that with effect from 15.1.2002 no heavy-, medium-or light-goods vehicles will ply on inter-State routes by passing through Delhi or Delhi.",['Other'],,
It is only those goods vehicles which on payment of octroi/toll tax carry goods to or from Delhi which would be allowed to ply.,['Other'],,
The Commissioner of Police is directed to formulate a scheme in this behalf and give due publicity to all concerned and implement the same.,['Other'],,
"#Current Court#'s order dated 9th October, 2015 was in the same spirit intended to act as a restraint against vehicles not bound for Delhi entering Delhi.",['Fact'],,
The said direction appears to have been understood to mean as though vehicles not bound for Delhi could also enter Delhi provided vehicles pay ECC.,['Other'],,
"The true intention, however, was that the vehicles that are not bound for Delhi are diverted to alternative routes to bypass Delhi.",['Other'],,
"The levy of ECC has no doubt resulted in some diversion of such vehicles but a very large number of vehicles not bound for Delhi still appear to be entering Delhi on payment of ECC, stipulated by #Current Court# .",['Fact'],,
"In the circumstances, #Current Court# consider it necessary to make it clear that no vehicle which is not bound for Delhi will be allowed to enter from N.H.-8 which connects Jaipur to Delhi and N.H.-1 that connects the States of Punjab, Haryana and other northern States to Delhi via Kundli border. #Current Court# are limiting the restraint order to these two entry points for the present because from the figures given to #Current Court# the largest number of vehicles that are entering into Delhi are from these two entry points.",['Conclusion'],,
" #Current Court# according direct that traffic from these two entry points viz. Kundli border on N.H.-1 and Rajokri on N.H.-8, shall be diverted to bypass Delhi through such alternative routes as the transport/traffic departments of the governments concerned may stipulate.",['Conclusion'],,
"#Current Court# are further of the view that empty/unladen vehicles bound for Delhi, can enter Delhi on payment of ECC earlier stipulated by #Current Court# @ Rs. 700/- and Rs. 1300/- per vehicle depending upon the category to which the vehicle belongs.",['Observation_finding'],,
"We, however, direct that for Delhi bound vehicles loaded with goods, ECC will be twice the charge stipulated by #Current Court# by #Current Court#'s order dated 9th October, 2015.",['Conclusion'],,
"This measure shall, in #Current Court#'s opinion, discourage any vehicle trying to enter Delhi on a false pretext of the goods loaded on it being Delhi bound.",['Observation_finding'],,
#amicus_advocate# next argued that the transport vehicles registered on or before 2005 which are non-compliant with the current pollution control standards also need to be disallowed from entering Delhi even if the same are Delhi bound with goods loaded for consumption in Delhi.,['argument_amicus'],,
There was a consensus among learned Counsel for the parties even on this issue who submitted that #respondants# or #respondants# have no real objection if a direction to that effect is issued.,['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# accordingly direct that while vehicles ""bound for Delhi"" may enter on payment of ECC at the rates stipulated hereinabove, those registered in the year 2005 or earlier shall not qualify for such entry.",['Conclusion'],,
#respondants# and Union Territories concerned shall ensure that vehicles bearing registration numbers of the year 2005 or earlier do not enter Delhi.,['Fact'],,
#respondants# and Union Territories will evolve a suitable system for implementation of this direction.,['Fact'],,
"It was contended by #amicus_advocate# that since diesel vehicles are the most polluting vehicles contributing to the current state of affairs in Delhi, it is time to issue directions banning registration of any new private and/commercial light duty diesel vehicles in the National Capital Region.",['argument_amicus'],,
This submission was opposed by #advocate_respondant# who submitted that banning of commercial light duty diesel vehicles is likely to affect trade and commerce within Delhi and supply of essential commodities to the people living in the National Capital Region especially because such vehicles are used in large numbers for ferrying goods from one place to the other in the National Capital Region.,['argument_respondant'],,
"Messrs #advocate_respondant# and #advocate_respondant#, learned senior Counsel appearing for the automobile dealers selling diesel vehicles, also opposed any ban on registration of new private vehicles and commercial light duty diesel vehicles as proposed by #amicus_advocate#.",['Fact'],,
"Having given #Current Court#'s anxious consideration to the submissions made at the Bar, #Current Court# are of the view that the new commercial light duty diesel vehicles can for the present continue being registered in Delhi on account of the dependence of the public on such vehicles for supply of essentials.",['Observation_finding'],,
"There is, however, no reason why registration of private cars and SUVs using diesel with an engine capacity of 2000 cc and above should not be banned upto 31st March, 2016.",['Other'],,
It is noteworthy that diesel vehicles of 2000 cc and above and SUVs are generally used by more affluent sections of #Current Court#'s society and because of the higher engine capacity are more prone to cause higher levels of pollution.,['Fact'],,
A ban on registration of such vehicles will not therefore affect the common man or the average citizen in the city of Delhi.,['Other'],,
"#Current Court# accordingly direct that Registration of SUVs and private cars of the capacity of 2000 CC and above using diesel as fuel shall stand banned in the NCR upto 31st March, 2016.",['Conclusion'],,
"It was then argued by #amicus_advocate# that all taxis including aggregators like OLA and UBER plying in the National Capital Region may be moved to C.N.G. fuel within a reasonable time but not later than 1st March, 2016.",['argument_amicus'],,
 There was a general consensus on this subject also primarily because this subject is hoped by all concerned that this subject will contribute substantially to the reduction of the pollution. ,['Other'],,
"We, therefore, direct that all taxis including those operating under aggregators like OLA and UBER in the NCT of Delhi, plying under city permits shall move to C.N.G. not later than 1st March, 2016.",['Conclusion'],,
It was submitted by #amicus_advocate# that one of the contributors to the pollution in the city of Delhi is dust that rises from the roads and pavements which are not fully developed.,['argument_amicus'],,
It was submitted that #respondants# could be directed to vacuum clean the roads which will substantially reduce the pollution levels.,['Fact'],,
To the credit of learned Counsel for the #respondants# and #respondants# and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi #Current Court# must mention that a direction to that effect was not opposed by anyone of them.,['Fact'],,
"As a matter of fact, #advocate_respondant# learned Counsel for the #respondants# submitted that the #respondants# is very keen to undertake these steps to reduce the pollution levels and ensure that paving of roadsides starts immediately.",['argument_respondant'],,
"Vacuum cleaning will, however, take some time as the #respondants# shall have to purchase vacuum cleaning vehicles/appliances for use on the roads.",['Fact'],,
"#Current Court# accordingly direct the #respondants# to take immediate steps for repair of pavements and make pavements wherever the same are missing and also to take immediate steps for procurement of the requisite vacuum cleaning vehicles for use on Delhi roads expeditiously but not later than 1st April, 2016.",['Conclusion'],,
It was argued by learned Counsel for the parties that one of the major contributors to the current pollution levels is the construction activities going on in the National Capital Region.,['Fact'],,
It was submitted that #respondants# and #respondants# concerned must be directed to take steps to enforce the #respondants# rules and norms against those engaged in such construction activities to prevent further rise of pollution levels.,['Fact'],,
#Current Court# see no reason to decline a direction to that effect.,['Observation_finding'],,
#respondants# norms regarding prevention of pollution by putting curtains and other devices at construction sites must be strictly enforced by the enforcement agencies concerned.,['Fact'],,
#Current Court# direct accordingly.,['Conclusion'],,
"It is also contended by learned Counsel for the parties that one of the contributors to the pollution is burning of solid waste by local bodies like Municipal Corporation of Delhi, NDMC. and institutions that generate such waste.",['Fact'],,
It was submitted that burning of solid waste was impermissible under the relevant rules and that lapses on the part of the concerned authorities in the matter of enforcing the said rules is contributing to the deteriorating situation.,['Fact'],,
"It was, therefore, prayed that authorities including the local bodies and institutions within the National Capital Region be directed to refrain from disposing of solid waste by burning such waste and to take steps for proper management/disposal of such waste in a scientific manner following the norms and the requirements of the relevant rules in that regard.",['Relief_Prayer'],,
#Current Court# see no reason to decline that prayer either.,['Observation_finding'],,
"#Current Court# accordingly direct that the #respondants# and the local bodies concerned including Municipal Corporation of Delhi, NDMC and all other institutions that are generating solid waste shall take steps to ensure that no part of such waste is burnt and that proper arrangements are made for disposal of such waste in a scientific way without causing any hazard to environment.",['Conclusion'],,
There are a few other suggestions also mooted by learned Counsel for NCT of Delhi with which #Current Court# are not dealing at present as learned Counsel for #respondants# and the #amicus# wanted some time to examine the same and make learned Counsel for #respondants# and the#amicus# submission.,['Fact'],,
learned Counsel for #respondants# and the#amicus# may do so on or before the next date of hearing.,['Fact'],,
"Mr. Shyam Divan, learned Counsel for the toll collector-SMYR Consortium LLP, prayed for early hearing of Mr. Shyam Divan (I.",['Other'],,
"A. Number 366) for modification of #Current Court#'s Order dated 9th October, 2015 as according to the learned Counsel, the diversion of vehicular traffic away from Delhi is seriously impacting the contract entered into by the#appellants# with Municipal Corporation of Delhi",['Fact'],,
"In the circumstances, therefore, while #Current Court# adjourn these proceedings to Tuesday, the 5th January, 2016 to be listed along with all pending applications including those filed by the toll collector, #Current Court# direct that steps that #Current Court# have indicated hereinabove shall be taken by all concerned in the right earnest notwithstanding any order to the contrary passed by any court or authority or Tribunal whatsoever.",['Conclusion'],,
"Post on 5th January, 2016.",['Other'],,
