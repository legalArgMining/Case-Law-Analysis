The #appellants# was pointed out that loss of such trees would be permanent and irreparable to the present and future generations to come.,['argument_appellant'],,
"The #appellants# has clearly pleaded that the value attached to Rosewood and Teak wood has resulted in a mad rush by timber contractors in collusion with Government agencies, for making quick profits without any regard to the permanent damage and destruction caused to the rain forest and to the eco-system of the region.",['argument_appellant'],,
The #appellants# also pointed out that cutting and removing of trees is not limited only to the mature trees.,['argument_appellant'],,
"In their anxiety to make huge profits the entire forest areas are being cleared, by indiscriminate felling of trees.",['argument_appellant'],,
